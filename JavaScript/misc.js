//FIND CYCLE IN ARRAY
//Assumptions ------>
// 1) Start at the 0 index
// 2) The value of arr[i] is set as the next index (i) to go to
//     eg [1,4,6,5,3,4] begin at index 0 --> arr[0] = 1 now go to index 1 --> arr[1] = 4 now go to index 4 --> arr[4] = 3 now go to index 3 --> arr[3] = 5 now go to index 5 --> arr[5] = 4 now go to index 4 --> This is a cyclic array (infinitely repeating)
// 3) One number must be greater than or equal to array.length (otherwise will always infinitely repeat)
//GOAL : check if infinite loop or not
